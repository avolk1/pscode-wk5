// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Num1 % 2 = Value
If Value = 0 print EVEN
Else print ODD

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Input a, b, c, d, e
A + b + c + d + e = sum
Sum/5 = average

Print "Average" average

Min = a
Max = a

For i = 2 to 5
If a > i then min = i
If a < i then max = i

Print "Smallest" Min
Print "Biggest" Max
